 Introduction
 Crime_Rate_Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting
 crime rates based on various factors. The goal is to provide insights and
 predictive analytics to help law enforcement and policymakers take
 proactive measures.

 
 Features
 ● Data preprocessing and cleaning
 ● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 ● ARIMA(AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
 ● Feature selection and engineering
 ● Model training and evaluation
 ● Visualization of results


 
Technologies Used
 ● Python
 ● Pandas
 ● NumPy
 ● Scikit-learn
 ● Matplotlib
 ● Seaborn
 ● Jupyter Notebook


 
 Dataset
 The dataset used for this project is obtained from kaggle. It includes
 various features such as demographic information, socioeconomic
 factors, and historical crime data.


 
 Model Training
 The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict crime
 rates. The training process involves:
 ● Splitting the data into training and testing sets
 ● Normalizing and scaling features
 ● Training multiple models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest,
 etc.)
 ● Hyperparameter tuning


 
Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute
Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The results
are visualized using plots and charts for better understanding.
